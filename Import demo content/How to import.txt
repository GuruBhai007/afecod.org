You can import via ‘Tools -> Import’ in the WordPress admin area. After importing the included xml file, make sure to assign the menus to the proper locations under “Appearance -> Menus” and to set the desired static frontpage under “Settings -> Reading”.

When you run the import, you have the option to also import images. If you click this, the images will be imported from our demo to your server.

If you get an error during the import, be sure to check the folder permissions. Otherwise images can't be saved on the server.

If you want to import the Revolution Slider from The Company theme, you can select the 'revolution-slider-demo-content.zip' file in the demo folder of your choice when importing sliders from within the plugin.

Please take note that we paid for the images in our demo, and thus have a license to use them. So be sure to use your own images ;)

If you have any questions after running the import, please feel free to ask them on our support forum: http://support.redfactory.nl/

Have fun!
